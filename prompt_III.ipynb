Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n","# other attributes:\n","12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)\n","13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n","14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n","15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')\n","# social and economic context attributes\n","16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n","17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n","18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n","19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)\n","20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","Output variable (desired target):\n","21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit?
